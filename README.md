Project title: Water scarcity in Africa. Data Source: [Worldometers.info (Data from 2015 & 2016)](https://www.worldometers.info/water/#:~:text=Water%20Use%20by%20Country%20%20%20%20Country,%20%2019%2C433%2C602%20%2047%20more%20rows%20)  
I chose this topic because one of my geology professors recently addressed the issue of water wastage by American residents in a lecture on water resources issues. I tried to compare the water consumption in the US and some African countries in this graphic. I obtained the water consumption data around year 2015 through google search; the data of the United States is used as a benchmark, the data of Canada and Iceland are used to reflect the two models of developed countries without water shortage, and Mexico is similar to China and India: developing and relatively water-scarce countries. Mozambique and Kenya, as typical African water-scarce countries, have formed a clear contrast with the United States in terms of data.
